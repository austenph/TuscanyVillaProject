(Week 5 of We Can Code It Full-Stack .NET bootcamp weekend project)

Applied learning of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create responsive web site using page mockups from a designer (instructor). 
The project was to take an old website and, using the mockups provided, create a website with matching colors, layout,
and responsiveness. 

The website had a grid system, images with overlaying text, a responsive navigation bar, and a jumbotron with images. 

Given one week of learning and three days to complete the assignment I was able to fullfil all of the requirements 
and have a responsive design using bootstrap!
